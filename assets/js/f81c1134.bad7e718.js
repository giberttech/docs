Whether you\'re working with API responses, configuration files, or complex nested data structures, ReSQL makes it easy to understand and work with your data in a structured format.\\n\\n## Key Features\\n\\n- **\ud83e\udde0 Intelligent Schema Inference**: Automatically analyzes JSON structure and creates normalized relational tables\\n- **\ud83d\udd17 Smart Foreign Key Detection**: Deterministically identifies and creates foreign key relationships\\n- **\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f Multiple SQL Dialects**: Support for ANSI, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Redshift, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and Snowflake\\n- **\ud83c\udd94 Flexible ID Generation**: Choose between consecutive integer IDs or UUIDs for primary keys\\n- **\ud83d\udcca Data Export**: Export normalized data as CSV files or SQL INSERT statements\\n- **\u26a1 Performance Optimized**: Web Worker-based processing for large datasets\\n- **\ud83d\udd12 Privacy First**: All data processing happens locally on your machine\\n\\n## Why I Built ReSQL\\n\\nWorking with JSON data in relational databases can be challenging. Developers often struggle with:\\n\\n- Understanding the structure of complex nested JSON\\n- Manually creating database schemas\\n- Identifying relationships between data entities\\n- Converting JSON to normalized relational format\\n\\nReSQL solves these problems by automatically analyzing your JSON and generating clean, normalized database schemas with proper relationships.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nReSQL is available as both a web application and desktop application:\\n\\n- **Web Application**: Visit [resql.gilbert.cloud](https://resql.gilbert.cloud) to start using ReSQL immediately in your browser\\n- **Desktop Application**: [Download for offline use](https://software.gilbert.cloud/resql), better performance with large files, and native file system integration\\n\\n## Privacy and Security\\n\\nAll data processing happens locally on your machine. Your JSON data *never leaves your device*, ensuring complete privacy and security for sensitive information. This makes ReSQL perfect for working with confidential data.\\n\\nIn the future we may offer additional data processing options, but at the moment all data processing either occurs in your browser, or in the locally installed application (powered by Electron).\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nI\'m already working on exciting new features:\\n\\n- Enhanced schema evolution tools\\n- Python script generation\\n- Automated processing pipeline\\n\\nSome of these will likely be paid features, but a free version will continue to remain available for the forseeable future!\\n\\n## Try ReSQL Today\\n\\nReady to transform your JSON data into relational schemas? [Get started with ReSQL](/docs/resql/introduction) and see how easy it is to work with structured data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*ReSQL is developed by Gilbert Software - modern software solutions to the data-driven world.*"}]}}')}}]);
